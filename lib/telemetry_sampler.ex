defmodule Telemetry.Poller do
  @moduledoc """
  A time-based poller to periodically dispatch Telemetry events.

  Measurements are MFAs called periodically by the Poller process. These MFAs should collect
  a value (if possible) and dispatch an event using `Telemetry.execute/3` function.

  If the invokation of the MFA fails, the measurement is removed from the Poller.

  See the "Example - (...)" sections for more concrete examples.

  ## Starting and stopping

  You can start the Poller using the `start_link/1` function. Poller can be alaso started as a
  part of your supervision tree, using both the old-style and the new-style child specifications:

      # pre Elixir 1.5.0
      children = [Supervisor.Spec.worker(Telemetry.Poller, [[period: 5000]])]

      # post Elixir 1.5.0
      children = [{Telemetry.Poller, [period: 5000]}]

      Supervisor.start_link(children, [strategy: :one_for_one])

  You can start as many Pollers as you wish, but generally you shouldn't need to do it, unless
  you know that it's not keeping up with collecting all specified measurements.

  Measurements need to be provided via `:measurements` option.

  ## VM measurements

  The `vm_measurements/1` function returns common measurements related to Erlang virtual machine
  metrics. See its documentation for more information.

  ## Example - measuring message queue length of the process

  Measuring process' message queue length is a good way to find out if and when the process becomes
  the bottleneck. If the length of the queue is growing, it means that the process is not keeping
  up with the work it's been assigned and other processes asking it to do the work will get
  timeouts. Let's try to simulate that situation using the following GenServer:

      defmodule Worker do
        use GenServer

        def start_link(name) do
          GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, [], name: name)
        end

        def do_work(name) do
          GenServer.call(name, :do_work, timeout = 5_000)
        end

        def init([]) do
          {:ok, %{}}
        end

        def handle_call(:do_work, _, state) do
          Process.sleep(1000)
          {:reply, :ok, state}
        end
      end

  When assigned with work (`handle_call/3`), the worker will sleep for 1 second to imitate long
  running task.

  Now we need a measurement dispatching the message queue length of the worker:

      defmodule ExampleApp.Measurements do
        def message_queue_length(name) do
          with pid when is_pid(pid) <- Process.whereis(name),
               {:message_queue_len, length} <- Process.info(pid, :message_queue_len) do
            Telemetry.execute([:example_app, :message_queue_length], length, %{name: name})
          end
        end
      end

  Let's start the worker and Poller with just defined measurement:

      iex> name = MyWorker
      iex> {:ok, pid} = Worker.start_link(name)
      iex> Telemetry.Poller.start_link(
      ...>   measurements: [{ExampleApp.Measurements, :message_queue_length, [MyWorker]}],
      ...>   period: 2000
      ...> )
      {:ok, _}

  In order to observe the message queue length we can install the event handler printing it out to
  the console:

      iex> defmodule Handler do
      ...>   def handle([:example_app, :message_queue_length], length, %{name: name}, _) do
      ...>     IO.puts("Process #\{inspect(name)} message queue length: #\{length}")
      ...>   end
      ...> end
      iex> Telemetry.attach(:handler, [:example_app, :message_queue_length], Handler, :handle)
      :ok

  Now let's start assigning work to the worker:

      iex> for _ <- 1..1000 do
      ...>   spawn_link(fn -> Worker.do_work(name) end)
      ...>   Process.sleep(500)
      ...> end
      iex> :ok
      :ok

  Here we start 1000 processes placing a work order, waiting 500 milliseconds after starting each
  one. Given that the worker does its work in 1000 milliseconds, it means that new work orders come
  twice as fast as the worker is able to complete them. In the console, you'll see something like
  this:

  ```
  Process MyWorker message queue length: 1
  Process MyWorker message queue length: 3
  Process MyWorker message queue length: 5
  Process MyWorker message queue length: 7
  ```

  and finally:

  ```
  ** (EXIT from #PID<0.168.0>) shell process exited with reason: exited in: GenServer.call(Worker, :do_work, 5000)
    ** (EXIT) time out
  ```

  The worker wasn't able to complete the work on time (we set the 5000 millisecond timeout) and
  `Worker.do_work/1` finally failed. Observing the message queue length metric allowed us to notice
  that the worker is the system's bottleneck. In a healthy situation the message queue length would
  be roughly constant.

  ## Example - tracking number of active sessions in web application

  Let's imagine that you have a web application and you would like to periodically measure number
  of active user sessions.

      defmodule ExampleApp do
        def session_count() do
          # logic for calculating session count
          ...
        end
      end

  To achieve that, we need a measurement dispatching the value we're interested in:

      defmodule ExampleApp.Measurements do
        def dispatch_session_count() do
          Telemetry.execute([:example_app, :session_count], ExampleApp.session_count())
        end
      end

  and tell the Poller to invoke it periodically:

      Telemetry.Poller.start_link(measurements: [
        {ExampleApp.Measurements, :dispatch_session_count, []}
      ])

  If you find that you need to somehow label the event values, e.g. differentiate between number of
  sessions of regular and admin users, you could use event metadata:

      defmodule ExampleApp.Measurements do
        def dispatch_session_count() do
          regulars = ExampleApp.regular_users_session_count()
          admins = ExampleApp.admin_users_session_count()
          Telemetry.execute([:example_app, :session_count], regulars, %{role: :regular})
          Telemetry.execute([:example_app, :session_count], admins, %{role: :admin})
        end
      end

  > Note: the other solution would be to dispatch two different events by hooking up
  > `ExampleApp.regular_users_session_count/0` and `ExampleApp.admin_users_session_count/0`
  > functions directly. However, if you add more and more user roles to your app, you'll find
  > yourself creating a new event for each one of them, which will force you to modify existing
  > event handlers. If you can break down event value by some feature, like user role in this
  > example, it's usually better to use event metadata than add new events.

  This is a perfect use case for Poller, because you don't need to write a dedicated process
  which would call these functions periodically. Additionally, if you find that you need to collect
  more statistics like this in the future, you can easily hook them up to the same Poller process
  and avoid creating lots of processes which would stay idle most of the time.
